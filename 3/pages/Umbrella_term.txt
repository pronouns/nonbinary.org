[[Umbrella term]]s cover a group of ideas that have something in common. In this wiki, an "umbrella term" usually means a term that covers a group of [[sexual orientation|sexuality]] or [[gender identity]] labels that have something in common. A person could identify as one of the specific identities under an umbrella term, and/or [[pronouns#they|they]] could identify with the umbrella term itself, if applicable. One problem with umbrella terms is that they can be applied to large groups of people who don't all necessarily want to be identified by that term. 

Some umbrella terms in this wiki include: 

* '''[[Aporagender]]''' is a specific [[nonbinary]] identity, as well as an umbrella term for ''some'' nonbinary identities:&lt;ref&gt;http://aporagender.tumblr.com/post/88495444809/shutupsocialjustice-aporagender-aporagender&lt;/ref&gt; just the nonbinary identities that aren't male, female, agender, or between male and female."&lt;ref&gt;http://aporagender.tumblr.com/post/88773280769/so-like-agender-goes-under-apora-umbrella-what&lt;/ref&gt;, and not those that are "[[agender]], between male and female, or [[gender binary|binary]] trans people."&lt;ref&gt;http://aporagender.tumblr.com/post/88777570724/hi-id-like-to-know-how-aporagendered-is&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Demigender]]''' is an umbrella term for identities that have a partial connection to a certain gender.
* '''[[Gender nonconformity]]''' covers all kinds of [[gender expression]]s that don't conform to society's gender norms.
* '''[[Genderqueer]]''' covers many kinds of gender identities and expressions that don't conform to society's gender norms. Because many people don't like to be called by the reclaimed slur "[[queer]]", it's disrespectful to use "genderqueer" as an umbrella term for all nonbinary, transgender, or gender nonconforming people. Only use it for those say they want to be called by it.
* '''[[LGBT]]''' (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) is an umbrella term for some similar identities, but not an identity itself, since a person generally can't be all four things at once. There are several other ways of writing this initialism, such as LGBTQ, LGBTQQAP, and LGBT+. An alternative way of saying the same thing is the initialism MOGII (marginalized orientations, gender identities, and intersex)
* '''[[Queer]]''' is an umbrella term for all [[MOGII]] identities. Some people identify simply as "queer" for their sexual orientation, their gender identity, or both, without necessarily being more specific. However, as mentioned above, this is a reclaimed slur, and many don't want to be called by it. It should only be used as an umbrella term for those who willingly identify with the term.
* '''[[Nonbinary gender]]''' is an umbrella term for all gender identities that don't fit into the [[gender binary]] of "[[female]]" or "[[male]]."
* '''[[Transgender]]''' is an umbrella term for all gender identities and expressions that involve moving from one gender expression to another. This includes[[transgender women]], [[transgender men]], and many nonbinary people who identify with the term. 
* '''[[Xenogender]]''' includes many nonbinary gender identities defined in reference to very different ideas than female or male.
