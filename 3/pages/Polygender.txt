'''Polygender''', or '''poly-gender''', is a [[gender identity]] that falls under the [[multigender]], [[nonbinary]] and [[transgender]] umbrellas. Polygender individuals have several gender identities. Some define polygender as anyone having more than one gender: they may have two ([[bigender]]), three ([[trigender]]), or more. Others define polygender as strictly people who have more than three genders.  Polygender can mean that a person has all these genders at the same time, in a mix. Polygender can also mean that they change from one gender to the next at different times, in which case the word is used interchangeably with [[genderfluid]]. Some also use the word polygender interchangeably with [[multigender]].
