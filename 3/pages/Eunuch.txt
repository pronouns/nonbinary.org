[[File:Eunuch.svg|thumb|Eunuch [[gender symbols|symbol]].]]
A [[eunuch]] generally means a person who was [[AMAB|assigned male at birth]], and who was [[castration|castrated]].  Though many historical eunuchs were made so without their consent, eunuchs often occupied a nonbinary [[gender role]] (often called [[third gender]]), and some of them were what we now call [[transgender]]. Then, as now, some people are eunuchs by choice, and some of them see this as a [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity]].

Since this is not Wikipedia (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch Wikipedia's article on eunuchs]), this page should focus on eunuchs as a nonbinary identity, people throughout history who have become eunuchs by choice, and eunuchs in the context of nonbinary gender. 

'''Content warnings:''' This page may talk about some of the processes by which one becomes a eunuch, so expect some talk about surgery and genitals.

==Definitions and history==
Usually a eunuch is one who has been castrated either by at least taking away the gonads (testicles), called [[orchiectomy]], or by taking away the gonads as well as the phallus (penis), called [[emasculation]]. Eunuchs have existed for virtually all of written history: the earliest record of them was in Sumer, in the 21st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Maekawa, Kazuya (1980). Animal and human castration in Sumer, Part II: Human castration in the Ur III period. Zinbun [Journal of the Research Institute for Humanistic Studies, Kyoto University], pp. 1–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Maekawa, Kazuya (1980). Female Weavers and Their Children in Lagash – Presargonic and Ur III. Acta Sumerologica 2:81–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the creation of more elaborate kinds of [[surgery|gender-validating surgeries]], [[gender-variant identities worldwide|nonbinary and other transgender people in many cultures]] were also eunuchs by choice. Traditionally, [[Hijra]]s were eunuchs, and many of them today prefer to be so, even when they have the option to get the kind of surgeries that [[transgender women]] can get today. Some other identities that have often been eunuchs include Ashtime and [[Gallae]]. 

Eunuch is not necessarily a nonbinary or transgender identity. Many cultures around the world also had a tradition of making someone into a eunuch without that person's consent. The purpose of this was to ensure that they couldn't have children with a nobleman's concubines, or to give them a higher singing voice (Castrati). These eunuchs usually identified as [[men]]. Eunuch is also not necessarily a surgical process. In some ancient writings, sometimes "eunuch" means a person who hasn't been castrated, but who can't or won't have children, because of being sterile, [[intersex]], [[gay]], [[asexuality|asexual]], or just not interested. 

Some nonbinary people who identify as [[neutrois]] are or wish to become [[eunuch]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"FAQs." ''Neutrois.com''. http://neutrois.com/0/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;
