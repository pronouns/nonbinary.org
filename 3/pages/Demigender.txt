'''Demigender''' (from ''demi'' "half" + "gender") is an [[umbrella term]] for [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity|gender identities]] that have a partial connection to a certain gender. This includes the partly [[female]] identity '''demigirl,''' and the partly [[male]] identity '''demiboy'''. There are other partial genders using the "demi-" prefix for the same reasons. For example, '''deminonbinary''', '''demifluid''', '''demiflux''', and so on. Like non-binary, '''demigender''' is also an identity within itself, for people who feel connection to the concept of gender rather than certain genders. Being a demigender "is not dependent on how much (as in percentage) someone identities as one gender; it solely depends on if a person identifies as partially. For some, they may identify with two or more genders while others may not."&lt;ref&gt;Savage. "Demigender definitions." ''Demigender safe space.''

==Demigirl==
[[File:Demigirl flag.png|thumb|The demigirl flag by [http://transrants.tumblr.com/post/77071883543/demigirl-demiguy-flag-proposals Transrants]. Pink: female. White: agender or nonbinary gender. Gray: partial.]]
A demigirl is someone who only partially (not wholly) identifies as a girl or woman, whatever their assigned gender at birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/55798-definitions-master-list/ AVEN: Definitions Master List&lt;/ref&gt; They may or may not identify as another gender&lt;ref&gt;http://genderqueeries.tumblr.com/identities Gender Queeries: Some Genderqueer Identities&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to feeling partially a girl or woman. May also use the terms demigal, demifemale or demiwoman.

Alternatively, demigirl can be used to describe someone [[Assigned_at_birth#Assigned_Gender_At_Birth|assigned female at birth]] who feels but the barest association with that identification, though not a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria, or someone assigned male at birth who is trans feminine but not wholly binary-identified, so that they feel more strongly associated with “female” than “male,” socially or physically, but not strongly enough to justify an absolute self-identification as "woman".&lt;ref&gt;http://genderqueerid.com/gq-terms&lt;/ref&gt;

A demiboy, also called demiguy, is someone whose gender identity is only ''partly'' male, regardless of their [[sex#Gender Assigned At Birth|assigned gender at birth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://asexualityorg.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=gender&amp;action=print&amp;thread=9 Definitions Master List&lt;/ref&gt; They may or may not identify as another gender&lt;ref&gt;http://genderqueeries.tumblr.com/identities Gender Queeries: Some Genderqueer Identities&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to feeling partially a boy or man. They may also define their identity as both male and genderless ([[Agender|agender]]).

"Alternatively, demiguy can be used to describe someone assigned male at birth who feels but the barest association with that identification, though not a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria, or someone assigned female at birth who is trans masculine but not wholly binary-identified, so that they feel more strongly associated with 'male' than 'female,' socially or physically, but not strongly enough to justify an absolute self-identification as 'man'."&lt;ref&gt;"Demiguy."

==Demifluid==
Demifluid is a gender identity for "someone whose gender is partially fluid ([[genderfluid]]) with the other part(s) being static; an example could be: one part of their gender is 'woman' while the part that fluctuates is  'man' and '[[genderqueer]]'."&lt;ref&gt;Savage.

==Demiflux==

[[File:demiflux.png|thumb|Demiflux flag]]
Demiflux is a gender identity for "someone whose gender is partially fluid with the other part(s) being static; this differs from 'demifluid' as '-flux' indicates that one of the genders is neutral; an example could be: one part of their gender is 'genderqueer' while the part that fluctuates is 'agender' and 'woman'."&lt;ref&gt;Savage.

==Demigender==
Demigender is a gender identity for someone who partially identifies with the concept of gender. A simple way of viewing this could be an opposite gender identity to [[agender]], which is often understood as absence of gender (as a concept). Just as [[non-binary]] is both an umbrella term and an identity within itself, so to is demigender.
