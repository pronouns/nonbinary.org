[[Pumping]] is a body modification to the phallus (meaning a clitoris or a penis). This practice uses vacuum suction to stretch the phallus and make it larger. Normally this is temporary, but if done on a regular basis, it has long-term or possibly permanent effects toward making the phallus larger. For people who were [[AFAB|assigned a female gender at birth]], pumping can make it possible or easier to use their phallus for penetrative sex. A regular practice of pumping is also part of getting ready for a kind of [[surgery]] to pull the phallus outward and give it more usable length, called [[metaoidoplasty]]. These are both often a part of the physical [[transition]] of [[transgender men]], and for some [[transgender]] and [[transsexual]] people with [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity|gender identities]]. A person doesn't need to do this or any other particular part of physical transition in order to identify as [[male]] or [[nonbinary]], because all parts of transition are optional, and based on an individual's unique personal wants and needs.
