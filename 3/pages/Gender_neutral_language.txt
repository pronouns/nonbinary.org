'''Gender-neutral language''', also called '''gender-inclusive language''', is the practice of using words that don't give an idea of someone being female or male. For example, the word "fireman" gives the idea that a person in that work is male. An offer for a job as a "cleaning lady" gives the idea that only a woman should do the job. The gender-neutral alternatives are to say "fire fighter" and "janitor," respectively. Then it is easier to see that these jobs can be done by a person of any gender. Gender-neutral language is important in [[feminism]], because changing the way that people talk can help make [[sexism|sexist]] ideas less common. For example, the sexist idea that some jobs should only be done by people of certain genders.

Gender-neutral language is also important to people who have [[Nonbinary gender|non-binary gender identities]]. For one reason, this kind of talk helps fight against [[nonbinary erasure]], which is the common but wrong and sexist idea that there are only two genders. Since gender-neutral language doesn't give the idea that a person is male or female, it can also apply to people who identify as other genders, outside of the [[Gender binary|gender binary]]. Non-binary people can ask to be talked about in this way.

English has grammatical gender, but only a vestige of what it once had. Old English once had grammatical gender for inanimate objects, but this practice started to disappear in the 700s, and vanished in the 1200s. The population of England at that time spoke several languages, and the same inanimate objects had different genders in those different languages. They may have stopped using that part entirely just to make it simpler. English stopped using grammatical gender for inanimate objects, but it still uses grammatical gender for people and personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com. "English used to have gendered nouns?! Yes!" May 16, 2012. ''Dictionary.com'' (blog). [http://blog.dictionary.com/oldenglishgender/ http://blog.dictionary.com/oldenglishgender/]&lt;/ref&gt; There is enough to make a challenge for nonbinary people who don't want gendered language to be used for them.

Gender-neutral language has become common in English today largely thanks to the pioneering work by feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift. During the 1970s, they began the work of encouraging inclusive language, as an alternative to sexist language that excludes or dehumanizes women. Miller and Swift wrote a manual on gender-neutral language, ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing'' (1980). Miller and Swift also proposed a set of gender-neutral pronouns, [[Pronouns#Tey|tey]], although they later favored [[Pronouns#They|singular they]], or [[Pronouns#He or she|he or she]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Isele, "Casey Miller and Kate Swift: Women who dared to disturb the lexicon." http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall94/h2-isele.html &lt;/ref&gt; There are several books on gender-neutral English, such as Rosalie Maggio's book ''The Nonsexist Word Finder: A Dictionary of Gender-Free Usage'' (1989). 

Much of the language that is often called gender-neutral has a problem: it's more than a little bit male. This is the problem that the [[Pronouns#He|gender-neutral he pronoun]], "you guys," and similar kinds of language have in common. "Linguists call male terms used to include females ''androcentric generics.''"&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Romaine, ''Communicating Gender.'' Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1999, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Androcentric generics have several problems. It can be arbitrarily seen as either including women or excluding women depending on whims, which has made trouble for women when it happens in legal documents. It can also give the impression that someone is in some way male, which can be unclear or insulting to people of other genders.

Much of other gender-neutral language has a problem: it gives the idea that female and male are the only genders. For example, calling an unspecified person by [[Pronouns#He or she|he or she pronouns]], a speaker addressing "ladies and gentlemen," an invitation saying "both genders welcome," and so on. Much of Western society thinks this is inclusive enough, because it doesn't know there are other genders. This language excludes nonbinary people, who would prefer an unspecified person to be called "they" rather than "he or she," would prefer a speaker to address "the audience," and an invitation saying "all genders welcome."

This is a list of both standard (dictionary) and non-standard (created) terms and pronouns to include [[Nonbinary gender|nonbinary identities]]. It should be noted that while some are [[Agender|genderless]] or [[Third Gender|third gender]], others are multigender. Terms will be marked with the implied gender identity when possible.

'''Asterisk, Underscore, Punctuation'''

Pronounced as a pause or glottal stop.
In between "feminine" and "masculine" ending, the most common version:
* mein_e beste*r Freund:in
Either after the stem - or more realistically at the next best place that has nothing to do with feminine/masculine forms but makes sense for pronunciation:
* mei:ne bes_ter Freun*din
At random places:
* mei*ne best:er Freundi_n
Can be used consistently or mixed up like in the example above.


'''X'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministisch-sprachhandeln.org/leitfaden/kapitel2/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronounced like ''iks''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministisch-sprachhandeln.org/leitfaden/kapitel4/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* meinx bestx Freundx
(or e.g. Befreunx to avoid basing it on the masculine form)

Fairly well known -i words:
* der_die Studi, dix Touri
New words by the same pattern:
* dier  Mitbewohni, der*die Kollegi

Use the short -i forms or make up new endings and treat the word as neutrum.
* mein bestes Freundi
* mein liebes Mitbewohnsi

Use -mensch, -menschi, -person:
* das Postmenschi
* meine Liebhabperson
* der liebe Katzenbetreu-Mensch
Or just random words that you think are cute.
* Ich will Fotografierflausch werden.

==Russian==

''See also: [[Glossary of Russian gender and sex terminology]].''

Unlike English, Russian has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. While neuter allows some non-binary people adjectives to use, this gender is not ideal for non-binary people for grammatical reasons. The first is that most neuter nouns decline like masculine nouns. The second is that neuter animate nouns do not change in the accusative case, while both masculine and feminine nouns do. This implies that people using neuter words are not human.

==Spanish==

''See also: [[Glossary of Spanish gender and sex terminology]].''

Spanish has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. Like other Romance languages, it's very difficult to talk about a person in a gender-neutral way. This is because every adjective, noun, and article are all either masculine or feminine. It's difficult or even impossible to be completely gender-neutral in standard Spanish. However, feminists, LGBT people, and other activists today have made ideas for how to speak Spanish in a gender-neutral way when necessary. For example, it's now common for people to write "Latinx" or "Latin@" as a gender-inclusive version of "Latino" and "Latina". For more information, see [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_Spanish_and_Portuguese Wikipedia's article: Gender neutrality in Spanish and Portuguese]. 

===Letter substitution===

In Spanish, many nouns and adjectives end in either a masculine -o or a feminine -a. These same letters are also used in the grammatical gender of the definite articles. For example, ''niño bueno'' ("good boy") and ''niña buena'' ("good girl"); ''los amigos'' ("the friends," if the group has at least one man, or isn't known to be all women, although this can be used in a gender-neutral sense) and ''las amigas'' ("the friends," but only if the group is all women). Many people who want gender-neutral options for Spanish have had ideas for substituting these letters with something else that would make a word gender-neutral. These non-standard proposed alternatives are: 

* '''@'''. In this use, the "at" symbol is meant to look like a mix of a masculine o and a feminine a letters.&lt;ref&gt;Sikian. ''Reddit''.

It can be pronounced as "ao".&lt;ref&gt;http://genderfork.com/2013/question-gender-neutral-honorifics-in-spanish/&lt;/ref&gt; It's one of the most commonly used in this list.

* '''e'''. The letter E represents an alternative to the O and A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishforsocialchange.com/2015/05/living-as-non-binary-or-gender-neutral.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example: ''niñe buene'', ''les amigues'', ''Latine''. Many nouns and adjectives already end in -e, so it can sound natural to create new -e versions. A few words would need spelling changes to keep the pronunciation the same: if the E comes after a C, the C becomes "qu" (''chico – chique''); after G, it becomes "gu" (''gallego – gallegue'').&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Gubb.

For example: ''niñx buenx'', ''lxs amigxs'', ''Latinx''. This would go with the proposed neutral pronoun [[Pronouns#Spanish neutral pronouns|ellx]].

===Nouns===

In Spanish, every noun is either female or male. None have a truly "neuter" grammatical gender. There are some kinds of nouns that come close to being gender-neutral in some ways: epicene nouns, common gender nouns, ambiguous gender nouns, and newly-made neutral or genderqueer nouns. 

====Epicene nouns====

Some words, regardless of their own grammatical gender, are used for men and women alike, without changing the word's ending. Its article stays the same, too. (However, when these nouns are used for women, it's now acceptable in standard Spanish to optionally change to the feminine article.) These words are epicene (''epiceno''). This is the closest that standard Spanish gets to gender neutral language. 

Some signs that a word is epicene: 
* Some words that end in -o or -a are epicene, you can't tell by looking at them. Also, be warned that some nouns ending in -a are only for men, such as ''cura'', "priest".
* Words with the epicene ''-ista'' ending, which is used for occupations and people who do things. This is with the exception of ''modisto'', "male fashion designer".

A list of some epicene nouns in conventional Spanish: 
* ''ciclista'' = cyclist
* ''el cliente'' = client, but a female client can be ''la clienta''.
* ''el dentista'' = dentist of any gender, but a female dentist can be ''la dentista''.
* ''el especialista'' = specialist
* ''el estudiante'' = student of any gender, but a female student can be ''la estudiante''.
* ''el esposo'' = spouse. This is masculine and can mean husband, but it can also mean a spouse of any gender.
* ''la jefe'' = chef of any gender, but a female chef is ''la jefa''.
* ''el padre'' = parent. This is masculine and can mean father, but it can also mean a parent of any gender. "''Tengo dos padres''" can mean "I have two parents" or "I have two fathers."
* ''la persona'' = person
* ''el personaje'' = personage
* ''turista'' = tourist
* ''la víctima'' = victim. 

====Common gender nouns====

There are also words with a "common gender" (''común''), meaning that the word itself stays the same whether it's applied to a man or woman, but its article changes gender to match the binary gender of the person to whom it is applied.

Some signs a noun is common gender: 
* Many end in -e, in standard Spanish.
* Some end in -o or -a, so they look masculine or feminine.

A list of some common gender nouns in conventional Spanish: 
* ''el/la atacante'' = attacker
* ''el/la espía'' = spy
* ''el/la estudiante'' = student
* ''el/la mártir'' = martyr

====Ambiguous gender nouns====

Some words in Spanish aren't consistent in what grammatical gender they have. They've been used as feminine or masculine words depending on the place and time period. They may have one conventional version, plus an alternative gender that is used poetically or in archaic language. These words are rare. There are only about a hundred of them. They still mean the same thing even when their gender changes. (Unlike, say, ''la cometa'' "kite" and ''el cometa'' "comet.") They're called ambiguous nouns (''nombres ambíguos en cuanto al género'').

====New nouns====

People have created new, non-standard nouns. Some are gender-inclusive (can be used for men, women, and nonbinary people). Some are only for people who identify as nonbinary or genderqueer. 

One non-standard method for forming gender-inclusive and nonbinary nouns is by letter substitution, which is described above. This creates words such as: 
* ''abuel@'' or ''abuele'' = grandfather/grandmother/grandparent
* ''espos@, espose'' = husband/wife/spouse
* ''herman@, hermane'' = brother/sister/sibling
* ''niñ@, niñe'' = boy/girl/child
* ''novi@, novie'' = boyfriend/girlfriend/datemate

Traditionally, the word ''den'' has been used as a gender neutral pronoun and remains widely used today. However, depending on the context, the word ''den'' can also mean ''it'' leaving it unsatisfactory as a gender neutral pronoun for many who do not wish to be seen as comparable to an inanimate object. Since the 1960s, the person pronoun ''hen'' has become increasingly popular and will, in 2015, be added for the first time to ''Svenska Akademiens Ordlista'' (the Swedish equivalent to France's ''Dictionnaire de l'Académie française''). It usage, however, remains somewhat contraversial and is vigorously opposed by some.

The object form of hen is sometimes just hens. It is very individual.
