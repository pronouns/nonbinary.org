From ancient history to the present, many cultures around the world that have established [[gender-variant identities worldwide]], some of which are accepted as an essential part of their societies. These are the gender identities and roles that Western anthropologists have called '''third gender''', because they are different than the Western [[gender binary]] idea of [[cisgender]], [[heterosexual]], masculine [[men]] and feminine [[women]]. Identities that have been called "third gender" are often [[transgender]] and [[nonbinary]], and the "third gender" label pushes that interpretation. However, many of the identities that anthropologists call third gender are not nonbinary identities. This is part of why "third gender" is a problematic colonialist label. It can also be colonialist and problematic to call these identities by outside labels such as "transgender" and "nonbinary," in cases where the people in question haven't said that they would call themselves by those words.

Although it is challenging for Western writers to do so, it is important to talk about these identities without imposing modern Western ideas of gender on them, such as [[binarism]]. Sometimes it isn't clear to outsiders whether a certain apparently [[gender nonconforming]] or [[LGBT]] role was made of people who were like what they think of as gay cisgender people, transgender women, transgender men, or nonbinary people. It can be unwise for outsiders to try to fit them into those modern Western categories. However, it is also difficult to talk about them without doing something like that.

People who aren't members of these cultures and ethnic groups aren't entitled to call themselves by any of the following genders. That would be [[ethnicity and culture#Cultural appropriation that impacts trans people|cultural appropriation]], which means taking parts of somebody else's culture to use for yourself. It is acceptable to learn about these cultures, so long as one does not take what is not one's own. 

Outsiders should learn about cultures that accept transgender and nonbinary people so that you can support those people on their own terms, and so that you are informed about political challenges that those people face today. Outsiders should also learn about them in order to see that there have been hundreds of accepting cultures throughout history, that it has been done, and that it has worked, and that these genders have always been real. This gives hope for other cultures to become accepting as well.

==Third gender==
'''Third Gender''' is a catch-all category used by some Western anthropologists when talking about other cultures that have societal gendered roles for people who can be thought of as under [[nonbinary]], [[transgender]], and sometimes larger [[MOGII]] [[umbrella terms|umbrellas]]. Third gender includes [[Two Spirit]], [[Hijra]], and many other gender-variant identities worldwide. The people described do not necessarily call themselves anything analogous to the label "third gender," as the term is applied to them by external anthropologists. Additionally, the culture itself may not necessarily think of there being strictly three genders, either. Some Western writers have used "third gender" only for people who they consider to be on the [[transgender women|male-to-female]] spectrum, and "fourth gender" for people on the [[transgender men|female-to-male]] spectrum. Other writers use "third gender" to include both. A "third gender" label has also sometimes been applied to people more accurately described as [[cisgender]] [[gay]] or lesbian. There has been critical analysis&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/tbettch/Coloniality.htm The Coloniality of Power: Critiquing the Transgender Paradigm&lt;/ref&gt; about the use of the term third gender in anthropology and transgender rights movements as perpetuating the romanticization of cultures outside of the Anglo-Saxon West, and for this reason it is important to make the distinction that only people of the ethnic group which uses a particular designation are entitled to use it as an identity. For instance, someone who is not from India or of Indian descent should not refer to themself as hijra, as this would be [[ethnicity and culture#Cultural appropriation|cultural appropriation]]. Although there are strong historical patterns of the term "third gender" being used by white colonialist anthropologists to erase ethnic genders among People of Colour, it is important to remember that many phenotypically white cultures have also had nonbinary genders. It would, therefore, also be cultural appropriation for a non-Italian to refer to themself as a Femminiello, or someone who is not from the Balkans to refer to themself as a sworn virgin.

In ''Whipping Girl'', Julia Serano talks about some of the problems of how Westerners have interpreted gender variant people in other cultures as "third gender" in order to support those Westerners' own theories about gender. For example, she says that Will Roscoe, who studied Two-Spirit people in history, interprets those people as nonbinary in ''every'' case, even when the people themselves made clear that they identified as women or men. Roscoe does this to support his view that gender is always only a social construct. Serano wrote,  

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Because Roscoe is determined to demonstrate that Native American berdaches [Two-Spirit people] represent 'third genders,' he plays up the ways in which these groups showed signs of being separate from and/or a mix of female and male, while playing down evidence that some berdaches may have actually seen themselves as, or wanted to be, the other [binary] gender. While this is not difficult to do for certain berdaches (as these roles varied significantly between Native American nations), Roscoe sticks to his 'third gender' hypothesis even when analyzing the historical record of the Mohave ''alyha'' (MTF spectrum) [...] Despite the fact that the alyha 'insisted on being referred to by female names and with female gender references,' used 'the Mohave word for clitoris to refer to their penises,' received female facial tattoos, and took part in rituals where they simulated pregnancy, Roscoe still argues that they should be considered 'third gender' [...] Roscoe resorts to giving more credence to the judgments of non-gender-variant Mohave [...] Roscoe himself purposely uses inappropriate pronouns and favors birth sex over identified sex when writing about berdaches."&lt;ref&gt;Julia Serano, ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity.'' Unpaged.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''alyha'' in the case above is more analogous to Westerners' idea of a trans woman than a nonbinary gender. Serano says Roscoe interprets gender variant Two-Spirit people as a nonbinary "third gender" even when it means ignoring things the people in question said about themselves. Roscoe interprets them in his way, not theirs, in order to support his own views. He also did cissexist things such as calling people by different pronouns than the ones they asked for. This is common for how Western anthropologists talk about people who they call "third gender". The people in question might not identify as a nonbinary third gender like the anthropologists say they do at all. Outsiders need to be careful that they do not interpret gender roles in other cultures in ways that just support those outsiders' own views. Outsiders also need to be careful to not take the word of an anthropologist that a gender variant role is really a nonbinary "third gender," as it might not be a true fact. Third gender is a problematic and often misrepresented concept in anthropology.

==List of gender-variant identities==
This list focuses on identities that are most analogous to nonbinary gender. However, due to the problems of imposing outsider's views on these identities, this isn't clear in all cases. Some of the identities in the list below may be more analogous to binary transgender women and transgender men than to nonbinary identity. This should not list identities that are known to be more analogous to cisgender identities that are simply gender nonconforming or non-heterosexual. 

===Africa===
* In ancient Egypt (Middle Kingdom, 2000-1800 BCE), there were said to be three genders of humans: men, ''sekhet (s&lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;t)'', and women, in that order. Sekhet is usually translated as "eunuch," but that's probably an oversimplification of what this gender category means. It may also mean cisgender gay men, in the sense of not having children, and not necessarily someone who was castrated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendertree.com/Egyptian%20third%20gender.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Egypt, during the Mamluk Sultanate of the 1200s to 1700s, masculine children who were assigned female at birth ([[AFAB]]) could be raised as men.
* In Benin, when it was the Kingdom of Dahomey, it had the Mino, warriors who were AFAB and considered masculine.
* In Ethiopia, the Maale people had a gender role called Ashtime, for assigned-male-at-birth ([[AMAB]]) [[eunuch|eunuchs]] who live as [[women]], though later this became an umbrella term for all kinds of gender non-conforming AMAB people.
* In Madagascar, the Sakalava people have the Sekrata, who are analogous to binary [[transgender women]].

These are ''oroané'' (cisgender men), ''makkunrai'' (cisgender women), ''calabai'' (analogous to transgender women), ''calalai'' (transgender men), and ''bissu''. To be considered bissu, all aspects of gender must be combined to form a whole. Bissu may or may not be intersex.

This lasts until the child has reached marriage age, whereupon the child is pressured to switch to a female gender role.
* In classical Arabic writings, people called Mukhannathun (Arabic مخنثون "effeminate ones", "men who resemble women", singular mukhannath) were queer people who were assigned male at birth, analogous to transgender women, or to very feminine gay men, depending on the individual. In Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 41, Number 4910, Mohammed said to exile a mukhannath, and said not to kill them.&lt;ref&gt;USC-MSA compendium of Muslim Text: Partial Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 41:General Behavior (Kitab Al-Adab), Number 4910 http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/041.sat.html#041.4910&lt;/ref&gt; At one point during the Umayyad dynasty, a caliph ordered that all mukhannathun should be castrated. In response to this, a group of mukhannathun are recorded as having this conversation about it: "This is simply a circumcision which we must undergo again." "Or rather the Greater Circumcision!" "With castration I have become a mukhannath in truth!" "Or rather we have become women in truth!" "We have been spared the trouble of carrying around a spout for urine." "What would we do with an unused weapon anyway?"&lt;ref&gt;Rowson, Everett K.
