| Agents at the bank cannot fix this problem.  The computer system will not allow the title field to be deleted or left blank.  A branch manager gave information about how to elevate the concern to 'head office' and that was done on 2015-07-02.  As of letter written July 17, 2005 from TD Vice President (Community Relations) Scott Mullin, "A review across TD was undertaken and unfortunately due to the interdependencies of various technology systems, we are unable to immediately remove your title [...] However, we recognize the importance of the issue you have raised, and will be conducting further investigations to explore possible solutions to this issue.  Please be assured that we are taking your concern very seriously."
