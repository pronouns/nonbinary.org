'''Binarism''' is the common but wrong idea that there are only two genders, expressed in a way that is a feature of colonialism and Western imperialism, in which other cultures and people of color are forced to conform within the white, Western [[gender binary]] system. Binarism is a form of [[sexism]] that erases [[Nonbinary identities worldwide|ethnic nonbinary gender roles and identities]].

The word "binarism" is sometimes used to mean [[Nonbinary Erasure|nonbinary erasure]]. Both are forms of sexism based in the idea that there are only two genders. While they are related, the distinction is that binarism also involves racism and cultural prejudice.
