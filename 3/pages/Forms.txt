[[Forms]] and paperwork that ask for a person to state their [[gender]] are often a challenge for people who have a [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity]]. Some people who want to be recognised as nonbinary want to be able to mark their gender as "nonbinary" in forms, in some way. Other people would prefer that forms don't record gender at all, as this would make the least trouble. Forms usually only let a person say they are either [[female]] or [[male]], with unsatisfactory alternative options, or usually no other options at all. There can also be problems if the answer doesn't match the person's [[legal gender]]. Some forms ask for gender even when this information isn't helpful or relevant to what the organisation does. On paper, it can be possible to create a nonbinary option by leaving it blank or writing in a new option, but computerized forms are less flexible, and might need phone calls and emails to change after the fact. Such [[activism]] has often been successful in getting an organisation to change its forms.

The [[recognition]] page in this wiki keeps track of which organisations' forms do or don't allow people to mark their gender as nonbinary, or to omit a person's gender information.
