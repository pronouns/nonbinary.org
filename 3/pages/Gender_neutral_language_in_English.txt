'''Gender neutral language in English''' is easier than [[gender neutral language]] (also called gender inclusive language) in many other languages, because its grammatical gender is less pervasive than in, say, German or French. See the main article on [[gender neutral language]] for general reasons to use neutral language, common problems in using it, and its use for [[nonbinary]] people.

==History==

Although English has grammatical gender, it's only a vestige of what it once had. Old English once had grammatical gender for inanimate objects, but this practice started to disappear in the 700s, and vanished in the 1200s. The population of England at that time spoke several languages, and the same inanimate objects had different genders in those different languages. They may have stopped using that part entirely just to make it simpler. English stopped using grammatical gender for inanimate objects, but it still uses grammatical gender for people and personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com. "English used to have gendered nouns?! Yes!" May 16, 2012. ''Dictionary.com'' (blog). [http://blog.dictionary.com/oldenglishgender/ http://blog.dictionary.com/oldenglishgender/]&lt;/ref&gt; There is enough to make a challenge for nonbinary people who don't want gendered language to be used for them.

Gender-neutral language has become common in English today largely thanks to the pioneering work by feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift. During the 1970s, they began the work of encouraging inclusive language, as an alternative to sexist language that excludes or dehumanizes women. Miller and Swift wrote a manual on gender-neutral language, ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing'' (1980). Miller and Swift also proposed a set of gender-neutral pronouns, [[English neutral pronouns#Tey|tey]], although they later favored [[English neutral pronouns#They|singular they]], or [[English neutral pronouns#He or she|he or she]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Isele, "Casey Miller and Kate Swift: Women who dared to disturb the lexicon." http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall94/h2-isele.html &lt;/ref&gt; There are several books on gender-neutral English, such as Rosalie Maggio's book ''The Nonsexist Word Finder: A Dictionary of Gender-Free Usage'' (1989). 

==Words and alternatives==

This is a list of both standard (dictionary) and non-standard (created) terms and pronouns to include [[nonbinary gender|nonbinary identities]]. It should be noted that while some are [[agender|genderless]] or [[third gender]], others are multigender. Terms will be marked with the implied gender identity when possible.
