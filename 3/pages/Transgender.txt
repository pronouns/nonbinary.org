'''Transgender''' is an umbrella term covering all gender identities or expressions that transgress or transcend societyâ€™s rules and concepts of gender. To be trans usually means to identify as a gender other than the [[Sex#gender assigned at birth|gender one was assigned at birth]].  The category of transgender includes people who have the [[binary genders|binary gender]] identities of female ([[transgender women]]) or male ([[transgender men]]), and is often framed solely in binary terms. The transgender umbrella does include people with [[nonbinary]] gender identities, but not all non-binary people refer to themselves as transgender.
