'''Butch''' is an [[LGBTQ|LGBTQ+]] masculine [[gender expression]] or [[gender identity]]. While many people who identify as butch use the term in reference to their gender expression, others claim it as a [[nonbinary]] identity in itself. Butch is an identity that emerged in [[lesbian]] culture. Stereotypically, butches take the dominant role in relationships with [[Femme|femmes]]. Some people see butch as an identity that only lesbian [[women]] can have, and it's usually assumed to be an identity that only [[AFAB|people assigned female at birth]] have, whereas others see it as an identity that anyone can have. 


==Difference between butch and male==

Although butch is a masculine identity, it isn't the same thing as conventional manhood or masculinity. There are differences, particularly in how conventional manhood and masculinity involve conformity, whereas the [[MOGII]] qualities of butch make it subversive.

Butch gender expression through clothing doesn't follow the rules for how to dress conventionally as male or masculine, and in some ways is intentionally different. Butch clothing doesn't look the same as conventional men's wear. See the main article about these [[Clothing#Masculine fashion|clothing differences]].

[[Transgender men]] are not butch lesbians. Although trans men were assigned female at birth (or sometimes intersex), and some identified as lesbian before recognizing that they were trans men, the difference is that lesbians identify as women, and trans men identify as men. Masculinity is different than maleness. 

==Transgender butches==
While the term "transgender butch" could apply to a masculine trans person, regardless of [[sex#Gender assigned at birth|gender assigned at birth]], the term is often used in a more specific sense to describe a person who was assigned female at birth, has a masculine gender expression, and experiences [[gender dysphoria]] while identifying as butch rather than male or another gender. Transgender butches may identify as [[genderqueer]] or [[nonbinary]]; some claim butch as a specific non-binary identity. Transgender butches may also identify as lesbians or dykes independently of their gender identity. A similar term is "stone butch", which describes a butch who prefers to avoid genital stimulation in sexual settings, sometimes due to [[gender dysphoria]].
