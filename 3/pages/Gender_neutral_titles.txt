A '''gender neutral title''' is an alternative to the gendered honorifics Miss, Mrs, Ms and Mr, for people who don't fit the [[gender binary]] and therefore don't feel that a gendered title fits their identity. It is used in formal situations when it is inappropriate to refer to someone by their first or last name only.

For the most part, gender neutral titles without qualification/career connotations are not recognised by the general public or businesses/organisations. Activists and supporters are working toward awareness and acceptance of alternative titles. The generally accepted gender neutral titles are associated with qualifications and careers, such as Dr (Doctor) and Rev (Reverend).

For some nonbinary folk, being referred to with a gendered title can trigger [[gender dysphoria]].

==Changing your title==

===United Kingdom===
[[File:MXstatdecTEMPLATE.jpg|thumb|A UK-specific Statutory Declaration template for title change to 'Mx']]

A Deed Poll can be used to change your name and/or your title free of charge, if you can get two witnesses together.

A Statutory Declaration of title change (see image of template to the right) can be drawn up and presented to a regular solicitor to witness/sign for a cost of approximately £10.00 (this usually includes a couple of legal copies); having the solicitor draw the document up for you may incur a much higher cost (£70.00+). You do not usually need to make an appointment for this service as the process only takes a few minutes.

The Deed Poll Service notes that “There's no need to follow any formal procedure (such a executing a Deed Poll) if you only wish to change your title.  You simply need to start using your new title and notify all the record holders that you have changed it.”[http://www.deedpoll.org.uk/AreThereAnyRestrictionsOnNames.html#Section3.6]

==List of gender neutral titles==
Here follows an alphabetical list of gender-neutral or specifically nonbinary titles that are alternatives to Mr. and Ms.

===Ind===

'''How to use:''' Ind. Sam Smith. Ind. Smith.

'''Pronunciation:''' "ind" (IPA: ˌɪnd) or "individual".

'''History:''' The Ind title was coined by Torin "MinimalistFish" Unrealisk in early 2014, a [[genderless]] individual who goes by the Ind title. Unrealisk proposed it in a post to a social blogging website, Tumblr.&lt;ref&gt;Conversation thread between Orion Scribner (frameacloud) and Torin Unrealisk (minimalistfish). 2014-11-12. &lt;i&gt;A Glorious Abscence of Gender&lt;/i&gt; (personal blog). Torin Unrealisk. [http://minimalistfish.tumblr.com/post/102483931685/torin-unrealisk-thank-you-for-what-you-wrote-about-the http://minimalistfish.tumblr.com/post/102483931685/torin-unrealisk-thank-you-for-what-you-wrote-about-the] Or archive: [http://frameacloud.tumblr.com/post/102488535511/torin-unrealisk-thank-you-for-what-you-wrote-about-the http://frameacloud.tumblr.com/post/102488535511/torin-unrealisk-thank-you-for-what-you-wrote-about-the]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Meaning:''' According to the one who coined it, Ind is short for "Individual". This title may be more appropriate for those who do not feel "mixed gender" implied titles meets their gender-neutral standards. Ind was designed to be entirely free of gender, thus making it an attractive option for [[agender]] and [[gender nonconforming]] individuals.

"Ind. as a gender neutral title?" 2014-02-15. &lt;i&gt;A Glorious Abscence of Gender&lt;/i&gt; (personal blog). Torin Unrealisk. [http://minimalistfish.tumblr.com/post/76750503799/ind-as-a-gender-neutral-title http://minimalistfish.tumblr.com/post/76750503799/ind-as-a-gender-neutral-title] Or archive: [http://frameacloud.tumblr.com/post/102470317561/ind-as-a-gender-neutral-title http://frameacloud.tumblr.com/post/102470317561/ind-as-a-gender-neutral-title]&lt;/ref&gt;

===M=== 

'''How to use:''' M Smith. M. Smith.

'''Pronunciation:''' Pronounced ''em'' (IPA: ɛm), like the name of the letter M.

'''Meaning:''' Meant to be a neutral title that is not based off "mixing" binary genders. Based on the gendered titles Mr and Ms, just without the second letter.

'''Examples of use:''' In science fiction by Dan Simmons, ''Hyperion Cantos,'' all adult humans go by the title M.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticHonorifics&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Similar-looking titles:''' One potential problem with the neutral title "M" is confusion with the French title "M." short for "Monsieur," which is masculine, not neutral.

===Misc===

'''How to use:''' Misc Sam Smith. Misc Smith.

'''Pronunciation:''' Pronounced "misk" (IPA: mɪsk).

'''History and meaning:''' The roots of the word miscellaneous comes from the Latin *miscellus*, meaning “mixed,” following the rationale that a lot of [[nonbinary]] people would say that they have aspects of various genders at various times. [http://cassolotl.tumblr.com/post/3015181250/a-gender-neutral-title-misc First known mention] in January 2011.

===Mre===

'''How to use:''' Mre. Smith. 

'''Pronunciation:''' Pronounced ''mystery'' or ''misstree''. 

'''History and meaning:''' A play on non-binary gender often being perceived as "mysterious." One potential problem is that it contains the "mister" and "miss" sounds in the beginning. In 2001, Liz Menzel wrote, "As Mr. is short for Mister, and Mrs. was once short for Mistress, how about Mre., for 'Mistree' (or I suppose for 'mystery,' for those who demand their spelling)."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070310125817/http://aetherlumina.com/gnp/references.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meaning:''' The ''x'' acts as a wild card, taking the usual title format of Mr and Ms, and putting in an ''x'' to remove the gender in the title.

'''Popularity:''' In a 2016 survey involving over 3,000 nonbinary respondents, Mx was the most popular gender-inclusive title at 34%.&lt;ref name="CassolotlNBGQ2016"&gt;[http://cassolotl.tumblr.com/post/137953257500 NB/GQ Survey 2016 - the worldwide results], published 20 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As the result of nonbinary activists asking companies to offer the Mx title as an option in paperwork, this option is becoming more widely available and well-established. As of February 2015, "31 major and respected companies, organisations and governmental departments in the UK" have been shown to give this option.&lt;ref&gt;Cassian Lotte Lodge (mxactivist).

===Myr===

Myr, or myr, used as a gender neutral title, honorific, and proper noun in science fiction books by David Marusek. Its plural form is myren.&lt;ref&gt;cicadacicada. "New gender-neutral title." http://cicadacicada.tumblr.com/post/13856770096/new-gender-neutral-title&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Pr=== 

'''How to use:''' Pr Smith.

'''Pronunciation:''' The title Pr is pronounced "per" (IPA, UK: pɜː(ɹ), US: pɝ)

'''Meaning:''' It is intended as an abbreviation of "person". (source needed) 

'''Examples of use:''' One written record of its use as a genderless title is from 2001, in a press complaint by non-gendered activist Pr [[Christie Elan-Cane]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pr Christie Elan-Cane v Woman's Own about Accuracy." January 31, 2001. [http://presscomplaints.org/case/3431/ http://presscomplaints.org/case/3431/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Similar-looking titles:''' Pr. is also the title given to a Christian pastor.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sai===

Sai. In ''The Dark Tower,'' the title "Sai" is a gender neutral title, the equivalent Mr or Ms, as well as the honorifics sir or ma'am.

===Ser===

'''Pronunciation:''' Pronounced ''sair'', to rhyme with ''hair''. 

'''History and meaning (as a gender-neutral title):''' Used as a gender-neutral version of "Sir" in works of fiction such as Greg Bear's ''The Way'' novels, and the ''Dragon Age'' series of video games. 

'''Similar-looking titles:''' While the title "Ser" is hundreds of years old, and has been used in a lot of media, it does not always mean the same thing, and is not gender-neutral in all cases. It's also not always equivalent to Mr or Ms, and may imply that a person has a specific profession or status. In the 1400s, "Ser" was "an honorific title usually given to notaries."&lt;ref&gt;Girolamo Savonarola, ''A guide to righteous living and other works.'' p. 149. &lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth century in Tuscany, "Ser" was one of the titles given to physicians, and thus equivalent to "Doctor".&lt;ref&gt;David Gentilcore, ''Healers and healing in early modern Italy.'' p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In Game of Thrones, "Ser" is the title given to knights, who are exclusively male in that setting, so it is not a gender-neutral title there.&lt;ref&gt;"Knighthood." ''Game of Thrones Wiki.'' http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Knighthood &lt;/ref&gt; Many examples of fiction that uses Ser, but they don't all use it to mean the same thing, as can be seen in [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticHonorifics TV Tropes's article about Ser and other unusual honorifics in fiction]. "Ser" is also not to be confused with a similar title, "Sr," meaning "sister," the title given to a Catholic nun.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_honorifics &lt;/ref&gt;
