[[Lunagender]], also called '''monagender''', '''monegender''', or '''selenogender''' (all of which mean in some way "moon gender"), is a [[genderfluid|fluid]] [[gender identity]] that changes on a consistent, orderly cycle, reminding one of a lunar cycle.

==History==

In 2014, Tumblr user drkiriko/publicmiddleschool created and defined the terms monagender, monegender, and selenogender as: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A gender experience of fluidity in which your perception of your gender, or even the foundation of your gender itself, shifts in a consistent way in many ways over a period of days, weeks, months, or even years, especially with long or short periods of various [[xenogender]] based feelings and perceptions. like the phases of the moon, your gender experiences similarly phases over time, in a same or similar order, consistently. i suppose this would be a subset of genderfluidness with a focus on order &amp; xenogender feelings or feelings of gender that cannot be contained in a human understanding, but not always."&lt;ref&gt;drkiriko.

Similarly, in 2014, Tumblr user missjacksoninthemorning created and defined the label of lunagender as "a gender that one experiences in a sort of cycle, or in regular phases; a gender that can be best described as dictated by the cycles of the moon. can be modified, like lunagirl or lunaboy."&lt;ref&gt;missjacksoninthemorning, "Lunagender."
