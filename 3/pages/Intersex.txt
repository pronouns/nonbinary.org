'''Intersex''' people have some aspect of their physical [[sex]] that is inconsistent with conventional ideas of male and female sex. This difference is in their primary or secondary sexual characteristics, hormones, or chromosomes.

An intersex person may have any [[Gender identity|gender identity]]. They may agree with their assigned gender ([[Cisgender|cisgender]]), or they may think of themselves as [[Transgender|transgender]], or it may be more complicated. They may or may not think of themselves as being part of the [[LGBTIQAP]] spectrum.

A person with a [[Nonbinary gender|non-binary gender]] is not necessarily intersex, and instead may be ''dyadic'' (not intersex).

Intersex was one of the 56 genders made available on Facebook in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Shapiro, ''Gender circuits: Bodies and identities in a technological age.'' Unpaged.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyadism==

Dyadism is a common kind of [[Sexism|sexism]], the belief that humans are strictly ''dyadic,'' having only two sexes. In action, dyadism is discrimination against intersex people. That discrimination can include erasure, harassment, medical malpractice, lack of marriage rights, religious intolerance, human rights violations, and hate crimes against intersex people. Dyadism is also the basis of other forms of sexism, including [[Binarism|binarism]], the belief that people have only two genders.

Because of dyadism, doctors think of intersex conditions as an irregularity. As a result, intersex people were given so-called "normalizing" or "corrective" surgeries, often at a very young age, and without their consent.
