{{Stub}}
[[Websites and social networks]] that do or don't give [[recognition]] to [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity]] in their user forms. For nonbinary people, the most undesirable sites are those that require all users to mark their [[gender]] as either "[[female]]" or "[[male]]," with no other options. Similarly bad are sites that mark this choice as "[[sex]]" rather than "[[gender]]". Sites that are more friendly to nonbinary people are those that let users write in their own gender, give a wide variety of gender options to choose from a drop-down menu, give a third gender option such as "[[other]]", or don't ask about gender at all. Some sites also ask about a user's [[gender neutral titles|title]] or [[pronouns]], and ideally let users include more than the standard [[binary]] options for these.

==How to use this page==

Please add to the entries on this page. 

For easy skimming, the tables on this page use a colour code, loosely based on traffic lights, to show how friendly a site is to nonbinary people: 

* blue (#9ff) means it's friendly to nonbinary people. For example, you can write in your gender (even blank it), opt out of showing it, or it doesn't ask about gender at all.
* yellow (#ffb) means it's partly friendly to nonbinary people. For example, users must choose between showing a gender that is female, male, or other.
* red (#f99) means it's not friendly at all to nonbinary people. For example, it may require all users to be openly listed as male or female.
* white background means we don't have information about this yet, or some other situation (describe)

If you want to quickly create an entry for a site, but you don't want to tangle with the tables, please use this as a template for writing a draft of an entry in list form instead, which you can put on the Talk page, and an administrator will put it into the table for you:

: '''Site name,''' web address, and purpose.

: '''User sex/gender:''' Does the software require users to choose a sex/gender? Does it call it a sex or a gender? What options does it give for users to choose from? Does it allow write-in genders?

: '''User titles:''' Does the software call users by titles and honorifics? What options does it give for users to choose their own titles? Does it allow write-in titles?

: '''User pronouns:''' Does the software call users by pronouns? What options does it give to users for choosing their own pronouns? Does it allow write-in titles?

: '''Legal name policy:''' Does the site require users to give their legal name? Yes/no. Note how this is enforced.

: '''Other notes:''' Tell anything else relevant about how the site's software or administrators treat trans, nonbinary, and intersex issues. 

==Social media and Forums==

Some websites allow one to hide gender or sex selection or choose none, choose other, or (more rarely) provide trans* and intersex selections. Listed in alphabetical order.

| style="background-color:#9ff;"| No. The user profile has a field called "real name," but the user can put any name into it they want. Legal names are neither enforced nor commonly used on the site.
| No title field. The site has history of administrators saying transphobic things to users. 'Other' as an option was once available, but taken away sometime prior to 2011. After a [[neutrois]] user was told to leave the site if [[pronouns#It|it]] "did not wish to state [its] gender", and the administrators told [[pronouns#it|it]] the field was about a user's genital sex and not gender identity, the backlash caused DeviantArt's administrators to backpedal and re-add "Other" as an option in late 2011.
