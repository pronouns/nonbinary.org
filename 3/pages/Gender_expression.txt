'''Gender expression''' is "The way in which a person expresses their [[gender identity]] through [[clothing]], behavior, posture, mannerisms, speech patterns, activities and more."&lt;ref&gt;"LGBT resources: Definition of terms." [http://geneq.berkeley.edu/lgbt_resources_definiton_of_terms]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[gender binary]], the two main categories of gender expression are '''feminine''' ('''femininity''') and '''masculine''' ('''masculinity'''). Additionally, a gender expression can be '''androgynous''' ('''androgyny'''), though there is no agreement on whether androgyny means a lack of gender markers, or a mix of feminine and masculine gender markers. A feminine person isn't necessarily [[female]], a masculine person isn't necessarily [[male]], and an androgynous person isn't necessarily an [[androgyne]] or [[nonbinary]].
