[[Genital nullification]] can mean many different kinds of [[surgery|surgeries]] to take away most or all of a person's reproductive organs and genitals. Some [[transsexual]] [[nonbinary]] people seek this as part of their physical [[transition]] in order to be sexless, and in response to [[gender dysphoria]] that makes them feel alienated from having any kind of genitals.&lt;ref&gt;"What are neutrois?" [http://neutrois.com/0/neutrois.html http://neutrois.com/0/neutrois.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, one need not have genital nullification in order to be [[genderless]], because [[gender identity]] is different than physical [[sex]]. A person can be genderless while having genitals that most people would think of as [[female]], [[male]], or [[intersex]]. A person also need not identify as genderless in order to seek genital nullification. 

A person's options for genital nullification depend on what kind of body they started out with. For people who had a penis and testicles, genital nullification can mean using surgery to take away those parts, called [[emasculation]]. For people who had a uterus, vagina, and labia, genital nullification can mean using surgery to take away some of those parts, called [[hysterectomy]], [[vaginectomy]], and some kinds of [[Bottom_surgery#Changes_to_the_labia|labiaplasty]].
