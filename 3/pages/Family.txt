This page is for collecting resources on the topic of [[family]] that have to do with [[nonbinary]] identity.

==Family and relationship words==

Some nonbinary people don't feel right about being called words that give an idea of being female or male. Many words for family titles and relationships do: mother, brother, husband, girlfriend, and so on. Nonbinary people who prefer to be called by gender-neutral words can ask to be instead called parent, sibling, spouse, datemate, and so on. See the page [[Gender_neutral_language#Family_and_relationship_words|Gender neutral language - Family and relationship words]] for a long list. This includes some new words that are not just gender-neutral, but specifically [[genderqueer]], for nonbinary people only.

==Family trees==

A diagram of a person's family is called a genogram or pedigree. These diagrams use a symbols for different kinds of people and relationships. This includes some standard [[gender symbols|symbols]] for a person's [[sex]] or [[gender]]. A square represents a [[men|man]] or boy, and a circle represents a [[women|woman]] or girl. The standard genogram symbol for a person whose gender is unknown is a rhombus or triangle. Some nonbinary people, if they are put into a family tree diagram, may prefer to have themselves represented by a genderless symbol.
