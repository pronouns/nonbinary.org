==Life==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''When I was 13 I moved from Chichester to California and people thought I was an alien. I dressed really wildly. In those days I used to get a lot of trouble on the streets, but that's why I moved to New York at 20. It's a wonderful place. It's like a bird sanctuary for oddballs.

Born in 1971, Antony grew up in Britain, the Netherlands, and the U.S., where she moved to New York in 1990 to pursue a degree in Experimental Theatre [http://zagria.blogspot.com/2008/11/antony-hegarty-1971-musician.html#.U0GtcvldU-o].
