[[Antigender]] is a category of "Genders that can only be defined as the opposite of an existing gender. For instance: antiboy would be the opposite of a boy. antigirl would be the opposite of a girl.""&lt;ref&gt;http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91782643999/antigenders&lt;/ref&gt; The word was coined by asexualjavert&lt;ref&gt;http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91782643999/antigenders&lt;/ref&gt; and kgmps2.&lt;ref&gt;http://aporagender.tumblr.com/post/91274549054/introducing-antigenders&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, '''ungender''' (coined by Baaphomett) is a category of genders that are "Not without but a negative; an unboy would be the negative of a boy and an ungirl would be the negative of a girl."&lt;ref&gt;http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that this has a homonym that is widely used in the transgender community: "to ungender" is a verb similar in meaning to the verb "to misgender," that is, to portray someone's gender in a degrading way that they would not have wanted.) Antigenders are under the umbrellas of [[nonbinary]] and [[transgender]] identities, as well as possibly [[xenogender]]. 

==Specific kinds of antigenders==
