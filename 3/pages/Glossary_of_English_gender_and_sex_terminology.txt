This '''glossary of English gender and sex terminology''' shows actual language use. Unless a word is marked with a specific country, assume all these words may be used internationally, in any country where English is spoken. 

This could be called a [[MOGII]] glossary. This glossary's selection of words has a focus on [[Nonbinary gender|non-binary gender]] identities, and closely related subjects of gender non-conformity. This glossary also collects words about gender and sexuality, especially words used by or in reference to MOGII identities (transgender, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and asexual), as well as [[Intersex|intersex]] conditions, as these provide essential context, and often have an overlap with the main subject. The glossary includes psychiatric terminology as well as subcultural slang, and obsolete historical terms as well as very new words (neologisms). The words cover identity labels, gender-neutral pronouns, diagnoses, and political issues.

If you put more words into this glossary, try to only put in words that you wouldn't find in the average pocket dictionary. Give sources to show that the word is really used in the way you say, or, if the wiki has an entry about that word, link to it. Keep glossary entries short, about three lines long at most. If they get too long, make a new wiki article for them.

Although it is useful to learn how to understand specialized jargon, you can be more helpful to your readers if you keep your own writing easy to understand. When writing for this wiki, please try to use plain English as much as possible, and use specialized jargon only sparingly, and as needed.

'''Content warnings:''' In order to keep readers informed about how to not make offense to others, this glossary gives some words that some see as offensive or hate speech. Also, it is necessary for this article to talk about some sexual topics in detail.
