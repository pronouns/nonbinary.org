An '''identity''' is how a person thinks of [[pronouns#they|themself]], and what words they use to label themself. This includes identities in and related to the [[MOGII]] (marginalized [[sexual orientation|orientations]], [[gender identity|gender identities]], and [[intersex]]) spectrum. Many identities on the MOGII spectrum have their own [[flags|pride flags]], which use colour symbolism to tell about that identity.

==Romantic/sexual identities==
''See main article: [[romantic orientation]] and [[sexual orientation]]''

Some romantic/sexual identities include [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[asexual]]. These are identities, but not gender identities. 

==Gender identities==
''See main article: [[gender identity]]''

Some gender identities include the two [[binary genders]], [[female]] and [[male]], and many others. There are some identities that are considered gender identities by only some of the people who have those identities, such as [[androgyne]], [[boi]], [[butch]], [[femme]], [[gender questioning]], and [[intersex]].

===Nonbinary identities===
''See main article: [[nonbinary gender]]''

There are many gender identities that are decidedly outside of the [[gender binary]]. See [[nonbinary gender]] for a list.

===Gender-variant identities worldwide===
''See main article: [[gender-variant identities worldwide]]''

Many [[ethnicity and culture|ethnic and cultural groups]] recognize gender identities outside of the Western female/male [[gender binary]], which anthropologists call "third gender". Some of these represent binary transgender identities, or [[cisgender]] lesbian/gay or [[gender non-conforming]] identities, but some are also transgender non-binary gender identities. See [[gender-variant identities worldwide]] for a list, and more information about the problems involved in imposing outsiders' labels on these identities. 

==Other identities==
This wiki also has articles on some identities that are not gender identities, such as [[otherkin]], or are not on the MOGII spectrum, such as [[cisgender]]. There are some identities that are disputed about whether they should be categorized with [[LGBT]], such as [[intersex]]. There are some identities that indicate only that they are associated with LGBT without being any more specific, such as [[queer]], [[gender nonconforming]], and [[questioning]].
