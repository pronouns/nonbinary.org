'''Trigender''', or '''tri-gender''', is a [[gender identity]] under the [[multigender]], [[nonbinary]], and [[transgender]] umbrellas. Trigender people experience exactly three gender identities, either simultaneously or moving between the three. (The latter version of this identity is also under the [[genderfluid]] umbrella.) These three genders can be any genders. For example: [[female]], [[male]], and [[Neutrois|neutrois]]; or [[male]], [[agender]], and [[genderqueer]].
