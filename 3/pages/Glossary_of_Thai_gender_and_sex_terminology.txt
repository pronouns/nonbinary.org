==D==
Dee: A lesbian or bisexual woman who follows outward gender norms. Historically, the distinction of ''dee'' was a relationship with ''tom'', a better-defined category. However, the ''dee'' identity is becoming more solidified, so that some women claim to have been "born to be dees".

==K==
กะเทย (''kathoey''): Term for a specific type of transgender person, connoting that the person self-identifies as a type of male but may undergo physical feminization, use female pronouns, and/or dress in female clothing. Thais may see ''kathoey'' as a third gender, or a type of male or female. The term "ladyboy" is used in English conversation and has become popular in South Asia. "''Kathoey''" may be used as a pejorative. Compare with สาวประเภทสอง (''sao praphet song'') and เพศที่สาม (''phet thi sam''). The term ''phu-ying praphet thi sorng'', or "woman of the second kind", can also refer to ''kathoey''.

==S==
สาวประเภทสอง (''sao praphet song''): Literally "a second type of woman". Roughly equivalent to "trans women" in the Western usage.

==T==

Tom: A woman who dresses and acts in a masculine way, and uses masculine pronouns. A well-defined alternative to normative femininity., it is associated with lesbianism, but is more a female gender identity than a marker of sexuality (unlike "butch"). See "Tom-Dee Identity".

Tom-Dee Identity: Identities for women who are traditionally masculine (''tom'') or feminine (''dee''), with implications that a ''dee'' would date a ''tom'' - though both are more gender than sexual identites. Buddhist teachings in Thailand discourage violence towards ''toms'' and ''dees'', seeing these identities as the result of karma from past lives and a cause for pity.
