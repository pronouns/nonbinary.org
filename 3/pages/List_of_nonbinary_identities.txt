This alphabetical [[list of nonbinary identities]] gives names of many kinds of [[gender identity|gender identities]] that are [[nonbinary]]. That is, those other than just [[female]] and [[male]], which are the [[binary gender]]s. This list gives names for nonbinary identities in English-speaking cultures, as well as [[gender-variant identities worldwide|those that are part of other cultures]]. (For the latter, please never use a word for your gender that belongs only to a culture or ethnic group that is not yours.) Some of these words for nonbinary genders have been used in writing for thousands of years. Meanwhile, some of these words were created last year. This page lists fewer of the older gender-variant identities than the new ones, because it can be harder to say whether it's accurate to put those in the category of "nonbinary."

'''Note to editors:''' Identities added to this list must demonstrate notability and cite sources (telling who coined them, when, and showing that they're in use by people), or else the entry will be deleted.

'''Content warnings:''' Some nonbinary gender identities have names that are reclaimed slurs. This page gives some words that some see as offensive or hate speech.
