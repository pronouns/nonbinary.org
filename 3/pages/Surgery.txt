[[Surgery]] can be part of the [[gender expression]] and physical [[transition]] of people with [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity|gender identities]]. Some nonbinary people call themselves [[transsexual]] and seek surgery, and some don't. A nonbinary person doesn't need to have or want surgery in order for their gender identity to be valid. This is true for [[transgender]] people of all kinds. For those nonbinary people who take a physical transition (and not all nonbinary people do), surgery is one option on their transition path. For some of those who do, [[gender dysphoria]] and body dissonance can make it so that they ''need'' physical transition and surgery. In that case, these can be life-saving procedures that are medically necessary. 

For transgender people of all kinds, there are two main kinds of gender-validating surgeries. [[Top surgery]] means any kind of surgery done on the chest or breasts. [[Bottom surgery]] means any kind of surgery on the reproductive organs or genitals. In addition to these two kinds, there are many more kinds of surgery that a person can see as gender-validating surgeries. For example, those to change the shape of the face, change the voice, remove fat from certain parts of the body, and so on.
