[[Conversion therapy]], also called reparative therapy, is any treatment with the goal of making someone who is [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) to stop being so. The treatment may take the form of counseling sessions, such as from a psychologist or religious minister, it may use physical treatments, such as electrical shocks, drugs, or lobotomy. Some adults choose to go into conversion therapy because they don't want to be LGBT. However, most often, conversion therapy is done to [[children]] and adults who didn't consent to it. This is done by [[family|families]] who wouldn't accept their child as LGBT. Without the person's consent, any kind of conversion therapy is abuse, and a violation of human rights. 

Conversion therapy without the person's consent still happens in many countries. It's still done in the [[Recognition (USA)|USA]], though conversion therapy on children has been banned in several states: California, New Jersey, Oregon, and the District of Columbia.

Since this is not Wikipedia, this wiki's article on conversion therapy should focus on conversion therapy's impact on transgender and [[nonbinary]] people in particular. This article should also focus on activism to bring this abusive practice to an end.
