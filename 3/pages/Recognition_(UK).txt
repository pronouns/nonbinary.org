[[Recognition (UK)]]. This article gives information on [[recognition]] of [[nonbinary]] gender identities in law, government, services, and businesses in the United Kingdom (UK). This also deals with policies about [[transgender]] people in general, and related policies about [[intersex]] people. Recognition here means whether an organization acknowledges that such people exist and have valid identities, and the organization does this by routinely giving them a place where they aren't forced into being wrongly categorized as a [[gender]] that doesn't match their [[gender identity]]. In the case of recognition of nonbinary people, this means the system doesn't force them to wrongly say they are one of the [[binary gender]]s ([[female]] or [[male]]). 

Follow to find lists of organisations in each category, with status on nonbinary acceptance and evidence.
