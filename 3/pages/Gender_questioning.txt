'''Gender questioning''' is a [[gender identity]] under the [[transgender]] umbrella. It is a tentative gender identity label for a person who is in the process of figuring out how to describe and label their gender identity, but has reason to think that they might be [[transgender]]. Such people may or may not have shown signs of being [[gender nonconforming]] or [[gender variant]]. Gender questioning is also a label that can be used by [[nonbinary]] people who are still figuring out exactly what kind of nonbinary gender they have.

==History==
