;Extract
&lt;blockquote&gt;“If pushed I say I am ‘gender neutral’ because psychologically, I feel no sway towards the ‘normal’ male or female genders.  Outwardly, I tend to dress as a girl, even though I have a man’s body.  If you ask me why, I couldn’t actually tell you.  There appears to be a contradiction when I describe myself as gender neutral and wanting to look female.  However, there is a big difference between your inward gender and your outward appearance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Extract
&lt;blockquote&gt;They might describe themselves as nonbinary, non-gendered, genderqueer, genderfree, trans, androgynous or all or none of the above or something else entirely. What they have in common is that they can't or won't fit into a simple binary definition of male or female.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Notes
:Specifically mentions 'nonbinary' and a number of identities under the umbrella. Gives a positive and accurate, if simplistic, description of nonbinary experiences. Includes extracts from interviews with multiple nonbinary people. Uses a town vs country metaphor for binary vs nonbinary gender. Discusses how children relate to nonbinary and gender variant adults. Featured in the blog section of the site.

;Extract
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''What harassment do you face?'''

I don't take hormones, so the majority of people perceive me as a woman, but obviously a woman who is transgressing gender norms. So the street harassment I get tends to be sexual aggression from cis [non-trans] guys, like "Hey baby, how about one up the arse?" or "Suck on this darling." Or trying to grope you in the street. Then it gets mixed in with the transphobia, when they’re not entirely sure if I’m female or male, that adds to that aggression and it just turns into "f**ing freak" or "faggot". I think one guy even came out with "You f**king pervert." I thought wow: you have no idea what I do in bed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Notes
:Sympathetic portrayal, primarily in the interviewee's own words. Uses the labels genderqueer, trans and transgender. Discusses street harassment, career prospects, access to services (changing rooms, taxis etc) and trans activism, as well as transgender themes in opera.

=====January 2012=====

======[http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=25&amp;editionID=209&amp;ArticleID=1979 Settling into gender: Francine Béar and Jennifer Wild on My Transsexual Summer]======

;Description
:Review of the [[Channel 4]] documentary series [[My Transsexual Summer]] from a psychological perspective, containing problematic wording.

;Author
:Francine Béar and Jennifer Wild

;Extract
&lt;blockquote&gt;Finding foot on the gender identity continuum is certainly a long journey when there’s a mismatch between biological and psychological sex. Channel 4 has done an excellent job in revealing the struggles that dominate when there’s a poor fit, what’s involved medically on the journey to make a better fit, and importantly, the need to see gender as spanning a continuum rather than a dichotomy. Only in seeing this, will we have a chance to transform the stigma, misunderstanding, and mockery that transgender individuals face when they take steps to be who they really are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Notes
:Positive about the programme itself. The only criticism is given to the over emphasis on surgery rather than psychological aspects, yet the article seems to conflate body dysphoria (or lack of it) with differences in gender identity, eg ''"wish to keep the parts of their bodies that make them male"'' (the programme also does this to a lesser degree). Talks about a '[[gender continuum]]' pointing to nonbinary gender, but it's not clear if this is talking about a continuum of bodies or gender identities (may imply that all trans people are somewhere along the continuum regardless of personal binary identities).

;Review
:[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/im-just-a-sweet-transgenderist-1613010.html Contemporary newspaper coverage of the episode (from the Independent)] (Includes inappropriate use of male pronouns for third gendered individuals).

;Notes
:Despite its age, this is still the most prominent prime time coverage of nonbinary gender on British television. The gender specialist psychologists interviewed, including [[Russell Reid]], are extremely hostile to nonbinary gender. The information and attitudes presented and the terminology used are now dated.


==United States==

===Newspapers, magazines and news sites===

====Associated Press====

=====November 2013=====

======'Preferred' pronouns gain traction at US colleges [http://news.yahoo.com/preferred-pronouns-gain-traction-us-colleges-064437446.html Yahoo] [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/01/preferred-pronouns-colleges_n_4367970.html Huffington Post]======

;Description
:Information on and quotes from students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges where use of preferred pronouns has become institutionalized. Mentions singular “they”, a variety of alternate neutral pronouns, and the only-by-name preference.

;Author
:[[Lisa Less]]

;Extract
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the University of Vermont, students who elect to change their names and/or pronouns on class rosters now can choose from she, he and ze, as well as the option of being referred to by only their names. Hampshire College in Massachusetts advertises its inclusiveness by listing the gender pronouns of its tour guides on the school's web site. And intake forms at the University of California, Berkeley's student health center include spaces for male, female or other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Notes
:Emphasizes that it’s not only college students, but also faculty and staff using neutral pronouns. Has a particularly uncomfortable passage where it seems to be setting nonbinaries in opposition to binary trans people: “But as fewer young people choose to undergo sex reassignment surgery, such students [binary trans students who are attributed with starting the campus inclusion movement] are slowly being outnumbered by peers who refuse to be limited”. Overall positive portrayal of the issue with relatively little space given to the “controversy” of non-binary identities and pronoun preferences. If anything, doesn’t give enough recognition to binary trans identities as opposed to non-binary.

== Netherlands ==

===Newspapers, magazines and news sites===

====Noordhollands Dagblad====

=====June 2015=====

;June &lt;19th
The newspaper reported in short blurbs that Dutch politicians had been working to remove the male/female indicator off of official documents, to specifically aid [[transgender]], [[intersex]] and nonbinary people (near quote). In a daily poll question, 81% of the readership indicated to approve of such endeavors.

;June 23rd
Starting of showing the “Call Me Caitlyn” ''Vanity Fair'' cover to illustrate the predominance of transgender people in media, the article continued to make a similar case for people of non-binary gender identities changing their names. Stating that (undefined) sources support that there exists a large number of non-binary people in the Netherlands, the article uses "intersex" as a catch-all term for non-binary gender, going as far as saying that "LGBTI" covers all possible gender identities.
