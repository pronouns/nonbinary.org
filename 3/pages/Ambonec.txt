[[Ambonec]] is a [[nonbinary]] [[gender identity]] in which a person identifies as both [[female]] and [[male]], and neither, at the same time. Coined by transmalenaoto (nbshadow) in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91796206149/ambonec-an-for-short&lt;/ref&gt; from Latin ''ambo'' "both" + ''nec'' "neither". Described by the one who coined it as a nonbinary "gender identity in which you identify as both male and female, yet you also identify as neither, at the same time. You can lean towards any sort of [[gender expression]] [...] if you wanted. You can use [any] [[pronouns]] if you wanted. You can identify this within bi/tri/qua/etc if you wanted. You can be [[demigender|demi]]-[ambonec], meaning there could be circumstances where it changes (mood, etc). You do not need [[gender dysphoria|dysphoria]] to identify as [ambonec]."&lt;ref&gt;nbshadow.

''Queer Querys'' (blog). [http://queerquerys.tumblr.com/terms http://queerquerys.tumblr.com/terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ambonec." ''Mogai-Archive'' (blog). 2014.

Similarly, the word "genderdox," coined by Tumblr user htt in 2014 based on the word "paradox," meaning simultaneously having genders and being genderless.&lt;ref&gt;"Genderdox." ''Mogai-Archive'' (blog). 2014. [http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91735540374/genderdox http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91735540374/genderdox] (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous submitter to the ''Mogai-Archive'' blog in 2014 also proposed a similar paradoxical gender: oppogender, meaning "when you feel/are two (or more) contradicting or generally ‘opposite’ genders at the same time, such as being simultaneously completely gender-null and another gender. ... alternative names: contrarigender, divergender, discrepantgender."&lt;ref&gt;"Oppogender."
