==Tilda Swinton on gender==
"I don’t know if I could ever really say that I was a girl – I was kind of a boy for a long time. I don’t know, who knows? It changes."&lt;ref name=thewip&gt;''[http://thewip.net/2009/03/20/interview-with-actress-tilda-swinton-i-am-probably-a-woman/ Interview with Actress Tilda Swinton: “I am probably a woman”]'', thewip.net, March 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"That whole idea of transformation is at the heart of what I’m interested in as a performer and not least through the idea of gender. It’s a very personal matter. I can categorically say that as Orlando does in the film: Yes, I’m probably a woman."&lt;ref name=thewip&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
