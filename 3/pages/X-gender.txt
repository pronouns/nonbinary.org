[[X-gender]] (Xジェンダー ''x-jendā'', or エックスジェンダー ''ekkusu-jendā''), in Japan, is a common [[transgender]] identity that isn't [[female]] or [[male]].&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Roxie. "Selected links on nonbinary gender in Japan." March 28, 2013. [http://genderqueerid.com/post/46526429887/selected-links-on-non-binary-gender-in-japan http://genderqueerid.com/post/46526429887/selected-links-on-non-binary-gender-in-japan]&lt;/ref&gt; The word X-gender is used in Japan in the way that [[genderqueer]] and [[nonbinary]] are used in English. It's related to terms used in the Japanese transgender community, FTX and MTX, which mean a divergent or unknown destination from the transitional paths FTM and MTF. It's also related to the use in some countries (including Australia and the UK) of “x gender” on paperwork for a gender other than man or woman.
