[[Recognition]] of [[Nonbinary gender|non-binary gender identities]] in law and other paperwork is an important issue confronting modern society. This also deals with policies about [[transgender]] people in general, and related policies about [[intersex]] people. Recognition here means whether an organization acknowledges that such people exist and have valid identities, and the organization does this by routinely giving them a place where they aren't forced into being wrongly categorized as a [[gender]] that doesn't match their [[gender identity]]. In the case of recognition of nonbinary people, this means the system doesn't force them to wrongly say they are one of the [[binary gender]]s ([[female]] or [[male]]). Through networking and [[Activism|activism]], people can find out which organisations acknowledge non-binary genders, and can ask for acknowledgement from organisations that still need to do so. 

For international recognition on the Internet, see [[websites and social networks]].

==Recognition worldwide==

One international problem is that all passports list gender (usually there called "[[sex]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Bishop. "Gender and Sex Designations for Identification Purposes: A Discussion on Inclusive Documentation for a Less Assimilationist Society." ''30 Wis. J.L. Gender &amp; Soc'y 131, 134-35.'' Fall 2015 (containing a broad comparative discussion of this problem in academic legal scholarship). available at http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wordpress/wjlgs/fall-2015-volume-xxx-no-2/&lt;/ref&gt; and most countries require that gender to be either female or male.&lt;ref&gt;"X gender markers on passports." http://lgbt.libdems.org.uk/en/page/x-gender-markers-on-passports&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries allow passports to have a nonbinary gender marker, called X (unspecified), T ([[transgender]] or [[third gender]]), E ([[eunuch]]), I ([[intersex]]) or O ([[other gender|other]]), depending on the country. Having a nonbinary marker on one's passport can make it impossible to [[travel]] to a country whose passports don't give that option.&lt;ref&gt;Aron Macarow. "These Seven Countries are Way Ahead of the US on Trans Issues." February 9, 2015. ''Attn.'' http://www.attn.com/stories/868/transgender-passport-status&lt;/ref&gt;

Another global problem for transgender rights is that many countries require too much of a transgender person in order to allow them to have a legal transition. Many countries require proof of [[surgery]] in order to do this. Many countries even require transgender people to be [[sterilization|sterilized]] in order to [[transition]]. International law calls compulsory sterilization a crime against humanity,&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still the law in many countries.

In the table below, countries are listed in alphabetical order, with a traffic light based colour code to make it easier to skim: 
* blue (#9ff) means it's friendly to nonbinary people. 
* yellow (#ffb) means it's somewhat friendly to nonbinary people.
* red (#f99) means it's not friendly at all to nonbinary people. 
* white background means we don't have information about this yet, or some other situation (describe).

| style="background-color:#f99;"| As of 2015, some politicians are working to introduce passports with an option for an X gender marker.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender neutral passports move a step closer to reality after Labour backing."

| In 2015, the Ministry of Justice stated that, unlike binary trans people, nonbinary people aren't protected under equality law.&lt;ref&gt;https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104639&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://beyondthebinary.co.uk/specificdetriment-what-you-told-us/&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, most kinds of paperwork and ID show a person's title, which is the main place where gender shows on those documents. Recognition of the [[gender neutral titles|gender-neutral title]] "[[Mx]]" is coming to be widespread.

| style="background-color:#ffb;"| All US official identity documents (passports, birth certificates, driver's licenses, and so on) that record gender (called "sex" in those documents) require people to be called either female or male, with no nonbinary options. This makes problems not only for people who have always lived in the country. The US State Department has no process for dealing with people who have nonbinary passports from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Kutner. "U.S. State Department has no process for accepting transgender passports." May 7, 2015. ''Salon.'' http://www.salon.com/2015/05/07/u_s_state_department_has_no_process_for_accepting_transgender_passports/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Jamie Shupe of Oregon became the first person in the USA whose legal sex is "non-binary,"&lt;ref&gt;Casey Parks, "Oregon court allows person to change sex from 'female' to 'non-binary'." June 10, 2016. ''The Oregonian'' (news).

| style="background-color:#ffb;"| Each state has different laws regarding legal transition. Most states require proof of surgery in order to legally transition, and the rest require a letter from a doctor saying you've had some kind of transition.
| In the USA, documents and ID rarely show a person's title.
