Many trans terms, especially the ones ending in "-gender", are simply copied from English. So if you're wondering if you can use your identity term in German without translating it, you probably can.

A source with more info and examples for the pronouns listet here can be found in the external links section.

==A==
* '''agender''' - agender
* '''androgyn''' - androgynous, androgyne
* '''androgynfühlend, androgynfühlig''' - literally "androgynous-feeling", has been proposed as a translation for androgyne, to clarify that it is not about androgynous looks
* '''Androgynität, Androgynie''' - androgyny

==B==
* '''bei Geburt zugewiesenes Geschlecht''' - sex/gender assigned at birth
* '''bigender''' - bigender
* '''Binder''' - binder, both German and English pronunciation used. "binden" (often with English pronuncioation), "(m)einen Binder tragen" and "abbinden" mean "to bind".
* '''biologisches Geschlecht''' - sex (as opposed to gender) and just as problematic as in English

==C==
* '''cis''' - cis
* '''Cisfrau, cis Frau, Cismann, cis Mann''' - cis woman/man
* '''cisgender, cisgeschlechtlich''' - cisgender

* '''em/ems/em/em''' - gender-neutral pronoun
* '''Enby''' - nonbinary person
* '''er_sie, er*sie, ersie''' - gender-neutral pronoun
* '''es''' - it, used as a pronoun by many nonbinary and intersex people, but insulting if used without consent

==F==
* '''FLIT, FLTI''' - "Frauen, Lesben, Inter*, Trans*": "women, lesbians, intersex- &amp; trans people" is often used to describe the groups invited to a certain event or location. Often with * placed after the T and/or I, sometimes without mentioning intersex as "FLT". Ideally means "everyone except non-intersex cis men", but since these evolved from women-only spaces, results vary and the reality can be exlusive of some trans and intersex people.
* '''Frann''' - Mx., but largely unknown
* '''FtM''' - female-to-male / trans man

==G==
* '''Geburtsgeschlecht''' - often short for sex/gender assigned at birth (bei Geburt zugewiesenes Geschlecht), but literally means something like "sex(/gender) at birth" so many aren't happy with that term
* '''genderfluid''' - genderfluid
* '''genderqueer''' - genderqueer
* '''Geschlecht, Gender''' - gender/sex ("Geschlecht" can be used for both "gender" and "sex", using "gender" as an anglicism is rather rare. Some use it to make sure everyone knows they are not talking about a biological reality. Others oppose it for that very reason, because using "Gender" implies there is also such a thing as biological "sex", while "Geschlecht" is ambiguous and can be filled with the preferred meaning.)
* '''Geschlechtsidentität''' - gender identity
* '''geschlechtslos''' - genderless, agender, ungendered
