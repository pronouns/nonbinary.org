'''Gender symbols''' are graphic designs that represent a [[gender]], such as the Venus symbol for female, and Mars symbol for male. Symbols for [[nonbinary]] gender identities explore variations on these. This page gives an imcomplete list of symbols for gender identities.

==Symbols based on Venus/Mars paradigm==

Like the Venus and Mars symbols for the [[binary genders]], these designs have a large, central circle, just with different prongs, angles, or other details. These designs may also use other astrological symbols.

===Binary gender symbols===

These are the basic symbols of the [[binary genders]].
