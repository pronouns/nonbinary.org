'''Two-Spirit''', or '''Two Spirit''', is the modern English [[umbrella term]] for [[MOGII]] identities and [[gender role|gender roles]] that are part of hundreds of Native American cultures. In 1990, the Native American/First Nations gay and lesbian conference agreed to choose Two-Spirit as an English umbrella term for some gender roles unique to Native American cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Two-Spirit." ''Wikipedia.'' Retrieved November 29, 2014. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit&lt;/ref&gt; They saw it as a better alternative to other, more problematic English labels that Westerners had applied to these gender roles, such as "berdache" and "[[third gender]]." 

'''People who are not Native American are not entitled to call themselves Two-Spirit'''. That would be [[ethnicity and culture#Cultural appropriation|cultural appropriation]]. People who aren't Native should instead consider using labels that are available to anyone, such as [[Bigender|bigender]] or [[Nonbinary|nonbinary]].

"Two-spirit" was one of the 56 genders made available on Facebook in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Shapiro, ''Gender circuits: Bodies and identities in a technological age.'' Unpaged.&lt;/ref&gt;
