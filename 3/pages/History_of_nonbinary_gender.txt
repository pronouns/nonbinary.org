This article on the '''history of nonbinary gender''' should focus on events directly or indirectly concerning people with [[Nonbinary gender|non-binary]] [[gender identity|gender identities]]. It should not be about [[LGBTQI]] history in general. However, this history will likely need to give dates for a few events about things other than nonbinary gender, such as major events that made more visibility of [[transgender]] people in general, [[gender variant]] people from early history who may or may not have been what we think of as nonbinary, and laws that concern [[intersex]] people that can also have an effect on the legal rights of nonbinary people. 

'''Content warnings:''' This history may need to talk about some troubling events that could have been traumatic for some readers. Some historical quotes use language that is now seen as offensive. 

==Tips==

Here are some tips for writing respectfully about historical gender variant people whose actual preferred names, pronouns, and gender identities might not be known.

* '''Dead names.''' It is disrespectful to call a transgender person by their former name ("dead name") rather than the name that they chose for themself. Some consider their dead name a secret that shouldn't be put in public at all. For living transgender people in particular, this history should show only their chosen names, not their dead names. In this history, some deceased historical transgender persons may have their birth names shown in addition to their chosen names, in cases where it is not known which name they preferred, or where it is otherwise impossible to find information about that person, if one wants to research their history. This should be written in the form of "Chosen Name (née Birth Name)." If history isn't sure which name that person earnestly preferred, write it in the form of "Name, or Other Name."
* '''Pronouns.''' It is disrespectful to call a person by pronouns other than those that they ask for. Some historical persons whose preferred pronouns aren't known should be called here by [[Pronouns#No pronouns|no pronouns]]. If this isn't possible, [[Pronouns#They|they]] pronouns. 
* '''Words for a person's gender, assigned and otherwise.''' It is disrespectful to label a person's gender otherwise than they ask for. In the case of some historical people, history has recorded how they lived, and what [[gender assigned at birth|gender they were assigned at birth]], but not how they preferred to label their gender identity. For example, it's not known whether certain historical people who were assigned female at birth ([[AFAB]]) lived as men because they identified as men (were [[transgender men]]), or because it was the only way to have a career in that time and place (and were gender non-conforming [[cisgender women]]). This should be mentioned in the more respectful form of, for example, "assigned male at birth ([[AMAB]]), lived as a woman," rather than "really a man, passed as a woman." For another example, writing "a military doctor discovered Smith was AFAB" is more respectful than saying "a military doctor discovered Smith was really a woman." For people who lived before the word "transgender" was created, it may be more suitable to call them "gender variant" rather than "transgender."

==Wanted events in this time-line==

Please help fill out this time-line if you can add information of these kinds: 
* Events in the movement for keeping the genders of babies undisclosed. 
* Events concerning [[nonbinary celebrities]], and historical persons who clearly stated they were neither female nor male, or both, or androgynes, etc.
* Skim nonbinary blogs looking for past and current historical events.
* Events that show that transgender and especially nonbinary gender identities existed long before the twentieth century.
* Changes in the use of gendered versus gender-neutral language.
 

==Earlier than the eighteenth century==

* Many cultures and ethnic groups have concepts of [[gender-variant identities worldwide|traditional gender-variant roles]], with a history of them going back earlier than the eighteenth century. For example, [[Hijra]] and [[Two-Spirit]]. These gender identities and roles are often analogous to nonbinary identity, as they don't fit into the Western idea of the [[gender binary]] roles. 
* Old English once had grammatical gender for inanimate objects, but this practice started to disappear in the 700s, and vanished in the 1200s. The population of England at that time spoke several languages, and the same inanimate objects had different genders in those different languages. They may have stopped using that part entirely just to make it simpler. English stopped using grammatical gender for inanimate objects, but it still uses grammatical gender for people and pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com. "English used to have gendered nouns?! Yes!" May 16, 2012. ''Dictionary.com'' (blog). [http://blog.dictionary.com/oldenglishgender/ http://blog.dictionary.com/oldenglishgender/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the fourteenth century, Middle English used a gender-neutral pronoun, [[Pronouns#A|a]], which is still in use in some living English dialects today.&lt;ref&gt;"Epicene pronouns." ''American Heritage Book of English Usage''. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080630041424/http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/004.html http://web.archive.org/web/20080630041424/http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/004.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighteenth century==

* "[[Pronouns#They|Singular they]]" had been the standard [[Pronouns|gender-neutral pronoun]] in English for hundreds of years. However, in 1745, prescriptive grammarians began to say that it was no longer acceptable. They instead began to recommend using "[[Pronouns#He|he]]" as a gender-neutral pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Bustillos, "Our desperate, 250-year-long search for a gender-neutral pronoun." January 6, 2011. [http://www.theawl.com/2011/01/our-desperate-250-year-long-search-for-a-gender-neutral-pronoun http://www.theawl.com/2011/01/our-desperate-250-year-long-search-for-a-gender-neutral-pronoun]&lt;/ref&gt; This started the dispute over the problem of acceptable gender-neutral pronouns in English, which still goes on today.
* In 1789, a native English dialect was recorded using gender-neutral [[Pronouns#Ou|ou]] pronouns. 

==Nineteenth century==

* 1858: Creation of the gender-neutral pronoun [[Pronouns#Thon|thon]] (a contraction of "that one"),&lt;ref&gt;Fred Barge, "Viewpoints from involvement -- 'thon'". ''Dynamic Chiropractic.''

* The earliest [[transsexual]] genital conversion [[surgery]] was performed in 1882 on a [[transgender men|trans man]] named Herman Karl (née Sophia Hedwig).&lt;ref&gt;James Sears, ''Gay, Lesbian and Transgender Issues in Education.'' p. 109. [http://books.google.com/books?id=w7365W7rQKQC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;ots=gSa98lwR0v&amp;dq=sophia%20hedwig%20transgender%20herman%20karl&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=sophia%20hedwig%20transgender%20herman%20karl&amp;f=false Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; However, "earliest transsexual genital conversion surgery" depends on one's definition. [[Eunuchs]] have been around for all of human history, and while many eunuchs consider themselves [[cisgender men]], many others consider themselves another gender that isn't female or male. Some sources credit the first trans male genital conversion surgery as, instead, the one performed on a trans man named Michael Dillon in the 1930s, perhaps depending on how one defines that surgery.

* During the 1950s, doctors made it common practice to try to surgically and socially erase all trace of the existence of [[Intersex|intersex]] conditions, without the consent or knowledge of the intersex infants in question. This practice was tied with many of the [[cisgender men|cisgender male]] sexologist John Money's claims about gender, which were influential to [[feminism]], but have since been drawn into question.&lt;ref&gt;"What's the history behind the intersex rights movement?"

* During the 1970s and 1980s, feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift were significant influences on encouraging people to take up [[gender inclusive language]], as an alternative to sexist language that excludes or dehumanizes women. Some of their books on this are ''Words and Women'' (1976) and ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing'' (1980). Miller and Swift also proposed a set of gender-neutral pronouns, [[Pronouns#Tey|tey]], although they later instead recommended [[Pronouns#They|singular they]], or [[Pronouns#He or she|he or she]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Isele, "Casey Miller and Kate Swift: Women who dared to disturb the lexicon." http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall94/h2-isele.html &lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1979, feminist [[cisgender women|cisgender woman]] Janice Raymond wrote the book ''Transsexual Empire,'' which told cisgender women to have fear of trans women. As a result, many feminist and women-only spaces became hostile to trans women. This dividing issue made it difficult for feminism to develop an understanding of transgender issues in general. In response, transgender studies began with an essay by trans woman Sandy Stone in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;"History of transgenderism in the United States." ''Wikipedia.'' Retrieved November 29, 2014.

* In the 1980s, the handbook of psychiatry, the DSM-III, put in a "Gender Identity Disorder," to diagnose people as transsexual.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Health editors, “Timeline of gender identity research.” 2002-04-23. http://www.trans-health.com/2002/timeline-of-gender-identity-research &lt;/ref&gt; It frames being trans as a strictly pathological mental condition. Getting this diagnosis becomes a necessary step for many trans people to transition. Psychologists during this time believed that a legitimately trans person needed to conform very closely to the [[gender binary]], and even needed to be [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]. The psychologists focused on trans women, and isolated them from one another, so they had little community. Meanwhile, trans men got less help from that system, and so they largely left it and formed their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;fakecisgirl, "The Misery Pimps: The People Who Impede Trans Liberation."
