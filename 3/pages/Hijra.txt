In south Asian countries including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the [[Hijra]] are people who were [[AMAB|assigned male at birth]] and who have a [[femininity|feminine]] [[gender expression]]. This is a very ancient tradition of a [[nonbinary]]  [[gender role]] (often called "[[third gender]]"). The Hijra in India alone may number as many as 2,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Gayatri, With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India, 310 pp., University of Chicago Press, 2005 ISBN 0-226-70755-5 (see p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Recognition==
