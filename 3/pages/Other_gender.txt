'''Other gender''', '''othergender''', or '''other''', is a [[gender identity]] under the [[transgender]] and [[nonbinary]] umbrellas. Some paperwork gives the option to mark one's gender as male, female, or other. In paperwork, "other" is for corporate entities for which gender is not applicable, as well as nonbinary people of all kinds. 

==History==

"Other" was one of the 56 genders made available on Facebook in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Shapiro, ''Gender circuits: Bodies and identities in a technological age.'' Unpaged.&lt;/ref&gt;
