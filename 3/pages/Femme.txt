'''Femme''' (or '''fem''') means an [[LGBTQ|LGBTQ+]] feminine [[gender expression]] or [[gender identity|identity]]. While many people who identify as femme use the term in reference to their gender expression, others claim it as a [[Nonbinary gender|non-binary gender identity]] in itself. Many think of "femme" as a word that only LGBTQ+ people can use for themselves, and perhaps even only by [[lesbian]] [[women]] (and therefore only by people who identify as [[women]]). This is because this identity emerged in the lesbian community, as a counterpart for [[butch]], a LGBTQ+ masculine female identity. There are many types of femme, such as [[stone]] femme.
