Genderflux is a [[gender identity]] in which the intensity of gender varies over time. A genderflux individual will go from feeling gendered to genderless.  Another way of putting it: genderflux is a form of genderfluid that fluctuates between being any gender and agender.  &lt;ref&gt;http://genderqueerid.com/gq-terms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://genderfluxsupport.tumblr.com/def&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: A genderflux female may go from feeling female to part female (demigirl) to genderless (agender).  It is not limited to binary genders.  

Genderflux can be used as a adjective or label (Ex: I am a Genderflux Demiboy), as a noun (Ex: Yesterday I experienced a really intense genderflux), or as a verb (Ex: I genderflux.  My gender intensity changes). &lt;ref&gt;http://crushingthebinary.tumblr.com/genderflux&lt;/ref&gt;

Genderflux individuals may also identify as [[nonbinary]], [[genderqueer]] and/or [[transgender]].

The term genderflux was coined by tumblr user: deergoths. &lt;ref&gt;http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Genderflux&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://crushingthebinary.tumblr.com/genderflux&lt;/ref&gt;
