'''Agender''' is also called '''genderblank'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/94743909934/genderblank http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/94743909934/genderblank]&lt;/ref&gt;, '''genderfree''', '''genderless''', '''gendervoid'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett]&lt;/ref&gt;, '''non-gendered,''' or '''null gender'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91779169274/null-gender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91779169274/null-gender]&lt;/ref&gt;. Agender is an identity under the [[nonbinary]] and [[transgender]] [[umbrella terms]]. Agender individuals find that they have no [[gender identity]], although some define this more as having a gender identity that is neutral.

==History==

In 2014, agender was one of the 56 genders made available on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Shapiro, ''Gender circuits: Bodies and identities in a technological age.'' Unpaged.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Dictionary.com added an entry for "agender,"&lt;ref&gt;"New words added to Dictionary.com." May 6, 2015. ''Dictionary.com.'' [http://blog.dictionary.com/2015-new-words/ http://blog.dictionary.com/2015-new-words/]&lt;/ref&gt; which it defined as "a person who does not have a specific gender identity or recognizable gender expression."&lt;ref&gt;"Agender." ''Dictionary.com.'' [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agender?s=t http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agender?s=t]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Agender as gender identity or lack of gender identity==

Some agender people feel that they have no gender identity, while others feel that agender is itself a gender identity. This is similar to and overlaps with the experience of being [[gender neutral]] or having a neutral gender identity.

As some agender people have no gender identity, it is important to not talk about nonbinary or transgender people's experiences ''only'' in the sense of gender identity.


==Difference between genderless and neutrois==

There is little agreement about the difference between terms such as agender, genderless, non-gender, gender neutral, and [[Neutrois|neutrois]]. These terms are often used interchangeably, or defined differently by individual writers in ways that don't necessarily match the self-definitions of others using those terms.

It is often said that non-gender or genderlessness is the experience of having ''no'' gender identity at all, whereas gender neutral or neutrois is the experience of ''having'' a gender identity, a gender identity which is not male or female, but neutral. However, these statements don't match the experiences of everyone who has taken up these identities as their own. This is a problem of a difference between word definitions that are ''prescriptivist'' (telling everyone how they ''should'' use a word, and saying that many people use it wrong) and ''descriptivist'' (describing how people have actually been ''using'' a word, without telling them to change).


===Non-gendered as an umbrella term===

Some activists, such as [[Christie Elan-Cane]] use '''non-gendered''' to mean all gender outside of the [[gender binary]]. This use comes from several years before the term '''nonbinary''', but is seen as problematic because it gives the idea that nonbinary gender identities don't exist, or that all nonbinary people are genderless. Nonetheless this usage is in some official organisations' documents and resources as the term to cover all nonbinary people. This is most common in the United Kingdom, for example throughout the recent [[UK Government Transgender Action Plan]].


==List of kinds of agender identities==

It can be difficult to describe and name a gender identity that involves a lack of inner gender identity. In order to do so, some people see the need to make new names for that gender identity, or to distinguish between different but similar genderless identities. A list of these names, in alphabetical order:

'''anongender.''' "A gender that is unknown to you and others".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92806103824/anongender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92806103824/anongender]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''apogender.''' Coined by queerspike. "Greek prefix apo, meaning away from, separate, at the farthest point; a subset of agender in which you feel not only genderless but entirely removed from the concept of gender."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92022599474/genders-coined-by-queerspike http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92022599474/genders-coined-by-queerspike]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''agenderfluid.''' Coined by pleurocarpus. Basically agender, but also [[Genderfluid|genderfluid]]. Synonym cancegender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/93177924884/cancegender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/93177924884/cancegender]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''agenderflux.''' Coined by perfectlybrokenbones. "Where you identify as agender but have fluctuations where you feel feminine or masculine but not male or female. ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92999709954/agenderflux http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92999709954/agenderflux]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''cancegender.''' coined by prideful-concerto. "An individual is agender as their “base” gender but experiences fluid/fluxing gender feelings in tandem with their emotions. These gender feelings may confuse or upset the individual and cause their emotional state to go haywire, which causes more gender changes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/93177924884/cancegender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/93177924884/cancegender]&lt;/ref&gt; Synonym agenderfluid. 

'''genderblank.''' As described by Damloz: Having no gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92539003104/agender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92539003104/agender]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as described by anonymous: "a gender so indescribable that the only thought one gets when trying to describe it is a blank space"&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/94743909934/genderblank http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/94743909934/genderblank]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''gendernull.''' As described by Baaphomett, "A gender like gendervoid but without the void."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''gendervoid.''' As described by Baaphomett, "A gender consisting of the void (also/originally used to mean the same thing as genderless)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91736136744/masterpost-of-genders-coined-by-baaphomett]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''librafluid.''' Coined by otterlyradical and pride-flags-for-us. "Mostly agender, but has a strong connection that fluctuates between masculinity and femininity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91929667279/librafluid http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91929667279/librafluid]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''null gender.''' Coined by dieselwolfe. "Undefinable, intangible, the uncreation of gender. Its taking everything everyone throws at you, saying male, female, pick one, pick this, pick that, and taking it in, only to expel it, poisonous crystals erupting from your skin, armor against those who don’t listen. A 'I don’t want a label because labels don’t fit but they help shut people up sometimes, so here have a label' gender label. A fall-back plan, a red herring to give people who can’t conceptualize the absence, void, nullification of gender. It is, and is not. All and none. Nonexistant but present."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91779169274/null-gender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/91779169274/null-gender]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''oneirogender.''' Coined by anonymous. "Being agender, but having recurring fantasies or dreams  of being a certain gender without the actual dysphoria or desire to actually be that gender day-to-day. e.g. oneiroboy, oneirogirl, oneirononbinary, etc."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92479134354/oneirogender http://mogai-archive.tumblr.com/post/92479134354/oneirogender]&lt;/ref&gt;
