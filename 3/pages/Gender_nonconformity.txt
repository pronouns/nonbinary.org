'''Gender nonconformity''' (also called '''gender nonconforming''', '''GNC''', or '''gender atypical''') involves not conforming to a given culture's gender norm expectations. Gender nonconforming is a phrase for someone whose [[gender expression]] doesn't match their society's prescribed gender roles or gender norms for their gender identity. Gender nonconformity transgresses societal or psychological expectations for perceived [[sex#Assigned Gender At Birth|gender assignment]], through presentation, behavior, identity, or other means. 

A person who is gender nonconforming may or may not consider themselves [[Transgender|transgender]], or even [[LGBT]] at all. Gender nonconformity is a broad term that can include transgender as well as [[cisgender]] people.

==Gender nonconforming children==

Although some people apply this label to themselves, one common use of the label is when adults use the label "gender non-conforming" for [[children]], in order to avoid outlining a child as having a particular [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]] while still young. The phrase "gender non-conforming" is used to include children who are called tomboys. For another example, the label is used for a child who was [[gender assigned at birth|assigned a male gender at birth]] and prefers giving what is seen as a [[gender expression#feminine|feminine gender expression]]. The child's [[family]] use this label so as not to outline whether this particular child might grow to self-identify as one of any of these: 
* A [[transgender women|transgender woman]]
* A feminine but still cisgender gay man
* A cisgender [[heterosexual]] man who just happens to be feminine
* Even just a phase of enjoying feminine expression in childhood, which the child outgrows 

Since it's not possible for the adult family of the child to predict what that behavior might specifically mean for that child's identity, they use an open-ended label. That said, it's common for people to feel very clear about their gender identity and sexual orientation from very early childhood. A child knows their own identity better than the adults around them, but doesn't have all the words for it.
