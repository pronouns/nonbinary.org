'''Multigender''' is an umbrella term, but may also be used as a specific gender identity. Multigender identities all fall under the [[nonbinary]] and [[Transgender|transgender]] umbrellas. The multigender umbrella includes [[Bigender|bigender]], [[Trigender|trigender]], [[Polygender|polygender]], [[Pangender|pangender]], [[Genderfluid|genderfluid]], and possibly [[Androgyne|androgyne]]. These identities all fall under the [[nonbinary]] and [[transgender]] umbrellas. Multigender individuals have more than one gender identity, either at the same time, or moving between different gender identities at different times. A multigender identity doesn't require a particular kind of body, so a multigender person could be [[female]], [[male]], or [[intersex]]. [[Pronouns#They|They]] may or may not seek a physical [[transition]] to change their body.
